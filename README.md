# sample-jwt-based-login-using-next

This is a simple demonstration of using middleware-based JWT verification in NEXT.js. It should work out of the box, without any setup.

The default password and username is hardcoded into `/api/auth` but in production you would probably match their username to a database and match their password's hash before letting them in. That isn't done here because this app is a demonstration of JWTs and not a fully featured authentication system.

### The project root is `/nextjsattempt/` and there's another README in there with instructions on running the app. Check it out!

### TODO: Convert JS to TS. This project was made before I learnt of TypeScript, So I'd like to convert it when I find time. 

I hope this helps you if you were thinking of making a login system in NEXT. ðŸ˜Š
